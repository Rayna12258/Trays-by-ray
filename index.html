          <p>
            <b>Trays by <i>ray</i></b> is a club/community project undertaken by a 1st year
            student whose genuine love for coffee overshadows anything &
            everything. Trays By Ray was completed in the late overnight hours
            of the first week of October on the top bunker bed of her friend.
            Thank you.
